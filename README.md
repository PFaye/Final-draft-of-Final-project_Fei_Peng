I built this website to share different parts of culture and life experiences. You'll find topics from music and nightlife to travel and personal interests here. When designing it, I wanted to make sure everyone could easily use and enjoy the site.

I picked pink as my main color scheme, using specific shades like #ff9ecd for primary, #ffd6e9 for secondary, and #ffb5d8 for accent colors. These warm pink tones make the site feel welcoming. The colors work well for all my content. They look just as good showing daytime pictures of DC landmarks as they do displaying nighttime scenes of Las Vegas bars.

For the text, I mixed three different fonts. I used Pacifico to make the main titles fun, Merriweather to make section headings look polished, and Roboto to make sure all the regular text is easy to read. This combination helps people understand what's most important on each page while keeping the site's personality.

Each type of content gets its own special layout, but they all feel like part of the same site. The Las Vegas bars are shown in cards that make it easy to find contact details. The music albums are arranged in a grid that adjusts to fit your screen size. For the DC landmarks, I made an interactive gallery that you can control with buttons or by touching your screen on mobile devices.

I made sure the site works well for everyone by using semantic HTML, adding alt text to images, and including a skip navigation link. The site adjusts to fit different screen sizes, with specific changes at 554px and 800px widths. Whether you're using buttons or touching the screen, all the interactive parts work smoothly.
